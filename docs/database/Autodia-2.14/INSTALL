-------

Autodia is a perl application and requires that perl is installed on your system. It should work with native unix perl or
activestate's perl on windows.

Vanilla Install

If you are running autodia against perl, c++ or PHP source code then you can install using the usual perl
technique :

% perl Makefile.PL
% make
% make test
% su
# make install

when you run perl Makefile.PL you may see a warning that requisites Inline and Inline::Java are not installed. This is fine if you 
do not need use Autodia with java.

the autodia program is called using 'autodia.pl' with arguments as required, if no arguments are passed then it will display
instructions.

for more detailed usage of autodia and developer documentation read the DEVELOP file and perldoc Autodia

Java Install

if You want to use autodia against java then you require some extra perl modules
- Inline
- Inline::Java

You will also need to copy the file named autodia_java over the file name autodia

so your installation would go :

% perl -MCPAN -e 'install Inline'
% perl -MCPAN -e 'install Inline::Java'
% cp autodia_java.pl autodia.pl
% perl Makefile.PL
% make
% make test
% su
# make install
