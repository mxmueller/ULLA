To Do
-----
This file contains the things that I plan to do in the near future

Redesign Diagram class to be a template class and move much of its logic
into UMLDiagram class, this would allow AutoDia to handle different types
of diagram.

Write some new handlers for perl, PHP and Python using semantic parsing and grammars
rather than hacked home rolled parsers.

Add more error checking to ensure the application copes better with less
sane code.

Correctly layout components and relationships using a more complex layout
system.

Add an XML based configuration or policy system allowing you to predefine settings and
even specify handlers and pattern matching without having to get your hands dirty in the
code.

Add ability to split projects into multiple diagrams and group contents of
a diagram/subdir into system boxes - much improving clarity in big
projects.
